# BreakFree: Habit Tracker

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/UC7TTzq2sf4

#### Description:

BreakFree is a full-stack web application developed using the **Flask** framework, **Python**, and a **SQLite** database. It functions as an advanced habit tracker focused on accountability and overcoming negative behaviors or addictions. The application implements complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations across two primary database tables (Users and Entries) to manage user data, habits, and daily logs securely and efficiently. The project's core objective was to integrate robust backend logic with an aggressive, custom-designed frontend to create a unique and highly motivating user experience, moving beyond the limitations of standard, visually bland productivity applications.

The application’s key functional features include: **Secure User Authentication** (registration, session management, and password hashing using `werkzeug.security`). A dynamic **Dashboard** serves as the user's primary hub, displaying critical metrics for each defined habit. These metrics—specifically the **Current Streak** and the **Best Streak**—are calculated dynamically in real-time within `app.py` using conditional database queries, guaranteeing accuracy and providing immediate, motivational feedback. The dashboard prominently features a **Progress Bar** that visually maps the current streak against the best streak or a defined goal, effectively gamifying the tracking process. The central function is the **Daily Entry Logging** system, which enforces accountability by requiring a mandatory binary outcome (Success or Relapse). Critically, the system requires users to log their **Emotional State (Mood)** and a **Journal Entry** using a customized form interface. This mandate provides essential psychological context for future behavior analysis and self-reflection, adding a vital layer of functionality beyond simple data logging.

A comprehensive **Habit History** page allows users to view, filter, and modify all past entries. This feature required advanced backend logic to handle filtering by habit ID and date range, ensuring efficient data retrieval and display. The ability to **Edit** or **Delete** past entries was a deliberate design choice, ensuring users maintain full control over their data for the tracking system to remain trustworthy and accurate. The application also includes a conceptual **AI Companion Chat ("BreakFree Buddy")** interface. While currently a placeholder, its architectural inclusion is designed to facilitate future integration with external large language models (LLMs) to provide automated support and personalized motivational prompts, further amplifying the application's unique value proposition.

The project structure adheres strictly to the conventions of a modular Flask application. The **`app.py`** file serves as the main controller, handling all application routing, user session management, and all direct database interactions. This includes complex SQL JOINs and aggregate functions necessary to calculate streak metrics and generate the detailed history view. The **`templates/`** directory contains all Jinja2 templates, with **`layout.html`** providing the base structure and integrating Flash messages. The **`static/`** folder contains the main stylesheet, **`styles.css`**, which is the single most defining file for the project's aesthetic. **`requirements.txt`** and **`Procfile`** are included to standardize the production environment, specifying dependencies like Flask and the necessary Gunicorn production server, facilitating deployment on services like Render.

The project's overall complexity is derived equally from its backend logic and its custom frontend styling. The aggressive **Cyberpunk Neon Aesthetic** demanded an extensive override of default Bootstrap styling, a decision that increased visual development time significantly. This required defining a precise color palette (`--neon-magenta`, `--neon-cyan`), implementing granular CSS rules for both `text-shadow` and `box-shadow` to simulate realistic neon glow, and applying these rules consistently to every interactive component (cards, buttons, form inputs) using dedicated utility classes (`.card-gamify`, `.btn-gamify`). Furthermore, **Client-Side Form Validation** was implemented using native JavaScript and DOM manipulation on the entry forms. This was a critical UX decision to eliminate unnecessary server load and provide immediate feedback, resulting in a much smoother user experience compared to relying solely on Flask's server-side validation. Finally, **Mobile Responsiveness** was meticulously addressed via a dedicated, detailed `@media (max-width: 768px)` query. This required specific structural adjustments, such as rewriting the display properties of the habit history table cells to stack vertically on mobile screens, thereby preventing horizontal scrolling and maintaining functionality across all device types. This comprehensive effort ensures the project successfully combines robust full-stack development with a visually distinctive and highly polished user interface, meeting the complexity required by CS50.
